# Flight Delays and Cancellations
In this project, I created tableau visualizations to reveal insights from a data set, that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
***
Insights and questions:
1. Which airlines have the more cancellations and for which reasons?
2. Which destinations airports have the more delays and in what time of year?
3. What is the relation between delays and cancellations for the different airlines?
